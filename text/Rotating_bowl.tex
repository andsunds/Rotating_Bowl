    This article decribes an inexpensive, yet experimentally
    challengenging way to determine the acceleration of gravity $g$,
    using a rotating liquid surface and a laserpointer. The main
    components of this metod is that a rotating liquid surface will
    form a parabola and that this parabola will focus the light to a
    known focal point.

\section{Introduction}
The acceleration of gravity, $g$, has been measured countless times in the
classroom. Usually this is done with some sort of pendulum or free fall. In a
case of experimental simplicity most of theese methods are hard to
beat. However, they do suffer from a sort of ``dullness'' -- the
physics behind them are quite basic and only involves Newtonian
mechanics. From the student's point of view, a pendulum experiment for
instance won't excite much experimental creativity. 

A more thought-provoking way to measure $g$ is to study the surface of a liquid
in a rotating bowl. By studying the centrifugala force in the rotating bowl
alongside gravity it can readily be shown that the gradient of the liquid surface in
the bowl will be proportional to the distance from the axis of rotation. This
corresponds to a parabola. More precisley the surface will follow the
equation \cite{Sabatka2010, Berg1990} 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parabola}
z(r)=\frac{r^2\omega^2}{2g}
\end{equation}
with the notation as in \figref{fig:rot_bowl}. In 2010 \v{S}abatka and
Dv\v{o}rák \cite{Sabatka2010} confirmed this experimentally using a set of metal
rods. 

The fact that the surface is parabolic can then be used optically. A parabolic
mirror will reflect any vertically incoming light to the focal point of that
parabola. This property was used by Berg\cite{Berg1990} in 1990 to focus light
into an optical image. 

The focus of the parabola in \eqref{eq:parabola} is located at the
height \cite{Physics_Handbook} 
\begin{equation*}
h=\frac{g}{2\omega^2}
\end{equation*}
above the vertex of the parabola. So by locating the focal point of the parabola in \eqref{eq:parabola} the value of
$g$ can then be caluclated as
\begin{equation*}
g=2h\omega^2.
\end{equation*}
As we can see here, only the focal height $h$ and the angular
frequency $\omega$ influence the value of $g$ making this method
experimentally quite clean with only two parameters to measure. 

Neither of these steps require very complicated theoretical caluculations, but
the steps are not all trivial. All in all the main principle here will give the
students an exercise in combinding knowledge from two parts of physics. At the
same time the student's experimental creativity can be used as there are many
ways of locating the focal point. 

A similar method have even been used as part of an
experimental problem in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)
2001\cite{IPhO2001}. IPhO is an international physics competition for
talented high school students from about 80 countries. So this method
already have quite good gounds as a challenging lab exercise.


\section{The apparatus and measuring method}
The apparatus shown in \figref{fig:rot_bowl_pic} consists of a bowl of water
on a spinning disk, a laserpointer, a central rod marking out the axis of
rotation, and a photodiode for measureing the speed of rotation. The spinning
disk was driven by a DC motor so the rotational speed could be adjusted by varying
the voltage applied to the motor. 

\begin{figure}
\centering

\resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\input{Figures/rot_bowl_pic.pdf_t}}
\caption{\label{fig:rot_bowl_pic} A photograph of the setup running. The
  reflected beam from a laser pointer (outside frame) can be seen on
  the central rod. } 
\end{figure}

The focal point will be located somewhere along the axis of rotation. So when
shining a laser vertically down on the parabolic surface the refection will hit
the central rod and the height $h$ over the vertex can be measured
using a narrow ruler. 

Then by varying the rotational speed and measureing the focal height for
different speeds a linnear regression could be made for $g$ as the
slope of the cuve of $h$ plotted against $1/(2\omega^2)$. 
Measurements were taken at two different radial distances from the
center to verify that the radial distance has no impact on the measured
value of $g$. 

The rotational speed $\omega$ was measured with a photodiode connected
to a digital oscilloscope wich could record several periods of
rotation. Though a more readily availible option is to connect the
photodiode to a computers microphone input and record the signal as a
``sound'' file on the computer, as \cite{Sabatka2010} did. Since
$\omega$ is one of the two parameters directly determining the value
of $g$, it's recomendet to measure the periods with some kind of
digital logging device such as an oscilloscope or computer, to
minimize uncertainty in this parameter.

\caption{\label{fig:rot_bowl} Schematic drawing of the setup in
  \figref{fig:rot_bowl_pic} together with the definitions of some of
  the notation used in the calculations. Due to the focal height
  beeing measured slightly outside the exact center of the rod, by
  $\rho$, a small correction $\delta$ has to be made to the measured
  focal height. }
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Calibration}
Firstly the laser pointer has to be perfecly vertical. This can neatly be
calibrated by shining the laser down on the watersurface when it's not
rotating. The laserbeam will then be perfectly vertical when the
reflection hits the source due to the watersurface beeing perfectly
horisontal when still.

To get the central rod centered, a center mark was put in the rotating
disc. A spirit level was used to ensure that the central rod was
vertical. Both of these steps are essential, since deviation from the
center will change the measure value of $g$, as we will see in next
section. 

\subsection{Corrections}\label{sec:corrections}
As shown in \figref{fig:rot_bowl} the measured focal height
$\hat{h}$ is slightly of from the real focal height by 
\begin{equation*}%\label{eq:correction}
\delta=\rho\cot 2\alpha
\end{equation*}
due to a finite width $\rho$ of the central rod. This width is easily
measured with a pair of calipers.

We now have to determine $\alpha$. First of we note that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dz/dr}
\tan\alpha=\frac{\rd z}{\rd r}=\frac{2 z(r)}{r}.
\end{equation}
Then we see from \figref{fig:rot_bowl} that 
\begin{equation*}
\cot 2\alpha =\frac{\hat{h} - z(r)}{\hat{r}} 
= \frac{\hat{h}}{\hat{r}}-\frac{r}{2\hat{r}}\tan\alpha,
\end{equation*}
where we used \eqref{eq:dz/dr} to substitute $z(r)$ in terms of
$\tan\alpha$. By rewriting the last equation we get
\begin{equation*}
\cot 2\alpha 
-\frac{\hat{h}}{\hat{r}}
+\frac{\hat{r}+\rho}{2\hat{r}}\tan\alpha  = 0.
\end{equation*}
only consisting of known or measured quantities and $\alpha$. From
this stage $\alpha$ can easily be obtained to a satisfying degree with
regular numerical equation solvers.

\section{Results}
The results from the measurements together with the least square fitt
are shown in \figref{fig:data}. The calculated value of the
acceleration of gravity comes out as
\begin{equation*}
g=\unit[9.78\pm 0.13]{m/s^2}
\end{equation*}
the uncertainty given is the standard deviation in the mean.


\begin{figure*}\centering 
\includegraphics[width=.65\linewidth]{g_minsta_kvadrat.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:data} Measurements of the focal height $h$ (with
  corrections for a center rod of non-zero width) plotted against
  $1/(2\omega^2)$. The acceleration of gravity $g$ is now given as the
  slope of the least square fitt to these data points. Measurements
  were taken at two different radial distances from the center,
  denoted $r$ in \figref{fig:rot_bowl}.
}
\end{figure*}


\section{Discussion}
As we can see, the result comes out close to the familiar value of $g$
as $\unit[9.8]{m/s^2}$. However, the error, of around 13\,\%, in this
method doesn't make this the most accurate way to measure $g$, but as
stated before this method is more of an educational experiment than a
precision measurement. And as such, this experiment manages to combine
both knowlege in mechanics and optics together with some careful
thought needed to, for example, find the correction $\delta$.

The significance of the correction due to finite width of the central
rod, $\delta$, is quite notable. The value of $g$ comes out to be only
about $\unit[9.2]{m/s^2}$ \emph{without} these corrections. This
demonstrates the necessity of the calculations made in section
\ref{sec:corrections}. 
%So if a student don't take this into account he or she will notice it
%and have to examine his or her experiment.

Most of the uncertainty in the result arose from small ripples on the
water surface leading to a gittery motion of the reflected
laserbeam. Both Berg\cite{Berg1990} and IPhO\cite{IPhO2001} used
glycerin as the liqud in thier experiments. Due to the high viscosity
of glycerin, the ripples causing the uncertainties would have lessend.
However as this experiment was primarily aimed as an experiment with a
simple and inexpensive setup we used water instead.  

Another way to increas accuracy would be to use a bigger bowl,
preferably a bowl with vertical walls. Because the maximal rotational
speed will be limited by the slope of the walls, since the walls have
to have a steeper slope than the watersurface.

The experiment described here can be done as a shorter project in high
school or lab exercise for first year undergraduate students. One
sholud note though, that to set up this experiment will take around
2--4~hours from scratch to finished measurements, depending on the
desired experimental accuracy. If this experiment is done as a
project, the student could perhaps also try to compare this method to
other more common methods.
