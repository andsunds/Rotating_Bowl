    This article decribes an inexpensive, yet experimentally
    challengenging way to determine the acceleration of gravity $g$,
    using a rotating liquid surface and a laserpointer. The main
    components of this metod is that a rotating liquid surface will
    form a parabola and that this parabola will focus the light to a
    known focal point.

\section{Introduction}
The acceleration of gravity, $g$, has been measured countless times in the
classroom. Usually this is done with some sort of pendulum or free fall. In a
case of experimental simplicity most of theese methods are hard to beat. 
However, most pendulum experiments are done from an expositiory
instruction, which is one of the most critizied laboratory
intructions~\cite{Domin1999}. From the student's point of view, a pendulum experiment
won't excite much experimental creativity --- there's only to follow the
given ``recipe''. 

A more thought-provoking way to measure $g$ is to study the surface of
a liquid in a rotating bowl. More precisely, the watersurface will
form a parabolic mirror, which will focus incoming planar light. This
is a property of parabolic mirrors most of us are familiar with, but
have never observed directly. 

A similar method have been used as part of an experimental
problem in the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO\footnotemark{})
2001~\cite{IPhO2001}. So this method already have quite good gounds as
a challenging lab exercise. However, in IPhO a different aspect of the
parabolic surface was used to determine $g$. Other than this, no
previous description of the use of a rotating liquid surface to
dertermine $g$ have been found.

  talented high school students from about 80 countries. } 



\subsection{Initial theoretical analysis}
To show that a liquid in a rotating vessel will form a parabolic
surface, one can either study the forces on the liquid in the rotating
frame of reference or simply start with some dimensional analysis. The
study of the forces have been done before~\cite{Sabatka2010, Berg1990}
and are not that hard to do. As to not repeat what's already been
done, a short dinesional analysis is presented here instead of the
full derivation. 

All symbols used in the following sections are given in
\figref{fig:rot_bowl}.

  beeing measured slightly outside the exact center of the rod, by
  $\rho$, a small correction $\delta$ has to be made to the measured
  focal height.} 
\label{fig:rot_bowl} 
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Dimensional analysis}
The method in this article relies on the fact that the surface is
parabolic, but it won't use this dimensional analysis any further than
as a novel way to, almost, derive the fomula of the surface in a
rotating bowl. 

To begin with, an assessment of which parameters will affect $z$ must
be made. One can here convince oneself that $z$, ideally, should be a
function of the three parameters $r$, $\omega$, and~$g$. If a power
law is assumed, the relationship can be written as
\begin{equation}
z\propto r^a\, \omega^b\, g^c.
\end{equation}
Here there are three unknown exponents.

However, it's easier to study the relationships of dinesionless
parameters, so $z/r$ is studied instead. Since this is dimensionless,
the relation to $z/r$ must be with other parameters which are also
dimensionless. The only posible solution is therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dim}
\frac{z}{r} \propto \left(\frac{r\omega^2}{g}\right)^\alpha, 
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ now is the only unkown exponent.

Furthermore, the surface should be smooth ererywhere. In particular,
the center of rotation can be a problem. The only possibility to get a
smooth surface in the center is if $\nicefrac{\rd{z}}{\rd{r}}=0$ when
$r=0$. This and \eqref{eq:dim} leads to the conclution that $\alpha>0$.

More than this can not be said about the surface given only a
dimensional analysis. Since it's known that the surface should be
parabolic, it follows that $\alpha=1$. 
Which is probably one of the most likely hypothesis a student would've
made at a first glance.  

\subsubsection{Theoretical and experimental confirmation}
The dimensional analysis showed that more information is needed to get
the full picture of the situation. To get this, one can look at the
forces acting on the liquid.

By studying the centrifugal force in the rotating frame of reference
alongside gravity, it can readily be shown that the gradient of the
liquid surface will be proportional to the distance from the axis of
rotation. This corresponds to a parabola. 

More precisley the surface will follow the
equation~\cite{Sabatka2010, Berg1990} 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parabola}
z(r)=\frac{r^2\omega^2}{2g}.
\end{equation}
In 2010 \v{S}abatka and
Dv\v{o}rák~\cite{Sabatka2010} confirmed this experimentally using a
set of metal rods. 


\subsection{Description of the experiment }
The fact that the surface is parabolic can then be used optically. A
parabolic mirror will reflect any vertically incoming light to the
focal point of that parabola. This property was used by
Berg~\cite{Berg1990} in 1990 to focus light into an optical image. 

The focus of the parabola in \eqref{eq:parabola} is located at the
height~\cite{Physics_Handbook} 
\begin{equation}
h=\frac{g}{2\omega^2}
\end{equation}
above the vertex of the parabola. So by locating the focal point of
the parabola in \eqref{eq:parabola} the value of $g$ can then be
caluclated as 
\begin{equation}
g=2h\omega^2.
\end{equation}
As we can see here, only the focal height $h$ and the angular
frequency $\omega$ influence the value of $g$ making this method
experimentally quite clean with only two parameters to measure. 

Neither of these steps require very complicated theoretical caluculations, but
the steps are not all trivial. All in all the main principle here will
give the students an exercise in combinding knowledge from two parts
of physics. At the same time the student's experimental creativity can
be used as there are many ways of locating the focal point. 




\section{Method and apparatus}
The apparatus shown in \figref{fig:rot_bowl_pic} consists of a bowl of water
on a spinning disk, a laserpointer, a central rod marking out the axis of
rotation, and a photodiode for measureing the speed of rotation. The spinning
disk was driven by a DC motor so the rotational speed could be
adjusted by varying the voltage applied to the motor. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{rot_bowl_pic.jpg}
\resizebox{0.7\linewidth}{!}{\input{Figures/rot_bowl_pic.pdf_t}}
\caption{A photograph of the setup running. The
  reflected beam from a laser pointer (outside frame) can be seen at
  the focal point on the central rod. } 
\label{fig:rot_bowl_pic} 
\end{figure}

The focal point will be located somewhere along the axis of rotation. So when
shining a laser vertically down on the parabolic surface the refection will hit
the central rod and the height $h$ over the vertex can be measured
using a narrow ruler. 

Then by varying the rotational speed and measureing the focal height for
different speeds a linnear regression could be made for $g$ as the
slope of the cuve of $h$ plotted against $1/(2\omega^2)$. 
Measurements were taken at two different radial distances from the
center to verify that the radial distance has no impact on the measured
value of $g$. 

The rotational speed $\omega$ was measured with a photodiode connected
to a digital oscilloscope wich could record several periods of
rotation. Though a more readily availible option is to connect the
photodiode to a computers microphone input and record the signal as a
``sound'' file on the computer, as \cite{Sabatka2010} did. Since
$\omega$ is one of the two parameters directly determining the value
of $g$, it's recomendet to measure the periods with some kind of
digital logging device such as an oscilloscope or computer, to
minimize uncertainty in this parameter.


\subsection{Calibration}
Firstly the laser pointer has to be perfecly vertical. This can neatly be
calibrated by shining the laser down on the watersurface when it's not
rotating. The laserbeam will then be perfectly vertical when the
reflection hits the source due to the watersurface beeing perfectly
horisontal when still.

To get the central rod centered, a center mark was put in the rotating
disc. A spirit level was used to ensure that the central rod was
vertical. Both of these steps are essential, since deviation from the
center will change the measure value of $g$, as we will see in next
section. 


\subsection{Corrections}\label{sec:corrections}
As shown in \figref{fig:rot_bowl} the measured focal height
$\hat{h}$ is slightly of from the real focal height by 
\begin{equation}%\label{eq:correction}
\delta=\rho\cot 2\alpha
\end{equation}
due to a finite width $\rho$ of the central rod. This width is easily
measured with a pair of calipers.

We now have to determine $\alpha$. First of we note that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dz/dr}
\tan\alpha=\dv{z}{r} =\frac{2 z(r)}{r}.
\end{equation}
Then we see from \figref{fig:rot_bowl} that 
\begin{equation}
\cot 2\alpha =\frac{\hat{h} - z(r)}{\hat{r}} 
= \frac{\hat{h}}{\hat{r}}-\frac{r}{2\hat{r}}\tan\alpha,
\end{equation}
where we used \eqref{eq:dz/dr} to substitute $z(r)$ in terms of
$\tan\alpha$. By rewriting the last equation we get
\begin{equation}
\cot 2\alpha 
-\frac{\hat{h}}{\hat{r}}
+\frac{\hat{r}+\rho}{2\hat{r}}\tan\alpha  = 0.
\end{equation}
only consisting of known or measured quantities and $\alpha$. From
this stage $\alpha$ can easily be obtained to a satisfying degree with
regular numerical equation solvers.



\section{Results}
The results from the measurements together with the least square fitt
are shown in \figref{fig:data}. The calculated value of the
acceleration of gravity comes out as
\begin{equation}
g=\unit[9.78\pm 0.13]{m/s^2}
\end{equation}
the uncertainty given is the standard error in the mean.


\begin{figure*}\centering 
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{g_minsta_kvadrat.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:data} Measurements of the focal height $h$ (with
  corrections for a center rod of non-zero width) plotted against

  slope of the least square fitt to these data points. Measurements
  were taken at two different radial distances from the center,
  denoted $r$ in \figref{fig:rot_bowl}.
}
\end{figure*}



\section{Discussion}
Since this is a completely new method of measureing $g$, it is not
easy to compare this particular result to other's. The closest
comparison we can make is to required results in
IPhO~2001~\cite{IPhO2001}. In the solutions to their problem
\cite{IPhO2001} states that $g$ could be measured to
$\unit[9.8]{m/s^2}$ with a standard error of $\unit[0.2]{m/s^2}$. So
compared to these results our seems to be atleast as good, or perhaps
eaven a little better than other methods using a rotating liquid. 

With this said, the error in this method is however, considerably
bigger than some of the most sofisticated pedulum
methods~\cite{Candela2001}. But as stated before, this
method is more of an educational experiment than a precision
measurement. And as such, this experiment manages to combine both
knowlege in mechanics and optics, together with some careful thought
needed, for example to find the correction $\delta$. 

The significance of the correction due to finite width of the central
rod, $\delta$, is quite notable. The value of $g$ comes out to be only
about $\unit[9.2]{m/s^2}$ \emph{without} these corrections. This
demonstrates the necessity of the calculations made in
section~\ref{sec:corrections}. 


\subsection{Experimental improvements}
Most of the uncertainty in the result arose from small ripples on the
water surface leading to a gittery motion of the reflected
laserbeam. Both Berg~\cite{Berg1990} and IPhO~\cite{IPhO2001} used
glycerin as the liqud in thier experiments. Due to the high viscosity
of glycerin, the ripples causing the uncertainties would have lessend.
However as this experiment was primarily aimed as an experiment with a
simple and inexpensive setup we used water instead.  

Another way to increas accuracy would be to use a bigger bowl,
preferably a bowl with vertical walls. Because the maximal rotational
speed will be limited by the slope of the walls, since the walls have
to have a steeper slope than the watersurface.


\subsection{Merits as a laboratory exercise}
The experiment described here can be done as a shorter project in high
school or lab exercise for first year undergraduate students. One
sholud note though, that to set up this experiment will take around
2--4~hours from scratch to finished measurements, depending on the
desired experimental accuracy. If this experiment is done as a
project, the student could perhaps also try to compare this method to
other more common methods.

As a way to move away from expository lab exercises, the method in
this article could be given as a more open problem to the
students. Depending on to what degree of replication of this exercise
is wanted, the student could for example be asked to determine $g$
using only some given equipment. But as always when there's no
``recipe'' to follow, some unintended solutions migth appear --- like
the one in \cite{IPhO2001}. Althogh this might not be an entirely bad
thing. 

The instruction, to determine something using a given set of
equipments and no information regarding the procedure, is very similar
to how a contestant in physics competitions, like IPhO, is presented
with their problems. Therefore an exercie set up with these minimal
instructions, might be most suited for students who already have a
good understandig of physics. 

Althogh these minimal instructions are common in IPhO, the problem in
2001~\cite{IPhO2001} had quite a lot of hints given to the
contestants. This indicates that the concept, of measuring $g$ with a
rotating liquid surface, could be too challenging for most students
with out help. Perhaps one could base a laboratory instruction in the
problem instructions given in \cite{IPhO2001}. 



\section{Conclusion}
This is a new, quite out of the ordinary, method to measure the
acceleration of gravity $g$. As an experimental method it fares well
compared to similar methods~\cite{IPhO2001}, but not as well to some
of the most accurate methods \cite{Candela2001}. 

As a laboratory exercie this method might prove quite challenging to
most students. But with sufficint help, the student will have used a
wide variety of different knowelge to reach the end result. The
student will also have seen the focusing property of parabolic mirrors
demonstrated while doing this experiment.
